Taking inspiration from the many other "TwitchPlays" style programmes, including that featured by Wituz https://www.wituz.com/make-your-own-twitch-plays-stream.html this software has been specifically created to be an easy to use for the gaming community.


# How it works

This project works by talking directly to the operating system *as if* it were a mouse or keyboard plugged into your machine. The twitch username should be updated to your own to connect it and read your channel chat messgaes for input. This code does not modify any game code nor any files on your computer.  It has been tested in Windows.

The main use case to date has been for streamers to allow their chat to enjoy a bit of interactive stream time with their favourite streamers during gameplay. Currently this code has been made for one game 'Phasmaphobia'.
